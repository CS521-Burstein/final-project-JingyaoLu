Economic cycle: 
The world economy is constantly developing in the cyclical alternation of prosperity and recession. The economic cycle is an inevitable economic fluctuation in the modern economic society and one of the basic characteristics of the modern economy. During the business cycle, fluctuations in economic activity occur in almost all economic sectors. Therefore, business cycles are fluctuations in the general economy rather than local economies. The basic indicator to measure the overall economic situation is national income, and the economic cycle is also manifested as the fluctuation of national income, and thus the fluctuation of output, employment, price level, interest rate and so on. The economic cycle occurs repeatedly in the operation of the economy, and generally consists of four stages: recovery, prosperity, recession, and depression. Affected by this, the price of corn will fluctuate accordingly. From the macroscopic analysis, the economic cycle is one of the most important influencing factors.
Currency exchange rate: Whether it is measured in RMB or USD as the currency of corn value, fluctuations in the actual currency value of the currency will inevitably have an impact on the spot price of corn, as well as on the futures price. Because there is a certain linkage between financial assets and commodity futures, in general, when the currency depreciates, the corn futures price will rise; accordingly, when the currency appreciates, the futures price will fall.
